Life is easier when everything is well organized. 

Be like Monica Geller (from F.R.I.E.N.D.S): organize all your stuff, get things done and simplify your day to day life and workload with this simple to-do list script implemented in Python. 

The purpose of this project is to create a basic but effective task manager to efficiently track, manage and complete a task or set of tasks. 

The user can create a new task, which is identified by its name and due date. The program allows the user to edit the name and due date of the task, mark it as completed and remove it from the to-do list. In addition, the user can keep track of all existing tasks in the to-do list, view all tasks that are already completed and the tasks due for today. 

## Dependencies:
Python 3

Libraries used: date, datetime

## How to run the script:
* Clone or download the repository to your local machine
* Run the To-do-list-app.py file in a Python environment
* Start organizing your life with this simple task manager!
